This mod (Previously called "Auto Untie Mechanic") lets you automatically free bound town NPCs

It also has functionality for allowing other NPCs to spawn in without their normal restrictions, including modded NPCs
Be warned though, some modded NPCs are very strong, or may be deprecated, and this mod doesn't account for that.

The mod should work in multiplayer, but if you want to change the NPCs that can spawn regardless of restrictions you will need to re-enter a world if you are already in one (both in single and multiplayer)
The bound town NPC functionality will work without reloading, just requires up to 60s of waiting time
